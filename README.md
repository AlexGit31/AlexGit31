# Welcome!

Hi, I'm Alexis, currently studying at Polytech Lille.  
I'm passionate about combining mathematics, data science, software engineering, and AI to build meaningful solutions.  

While I am strongly interested in working in quantitative finance, I am also open to opportunities in data science, data analysis, big data engineering, and AI-related fields.
